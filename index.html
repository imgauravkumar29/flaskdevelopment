        <h2>Papilledema</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Papilledema refers to optic disc swelling that is caused by increased intracranial pressure.  
                This increased pressure can be due to conditions such as hydrocephalus, brain tumors, intracranial hemorrhage,
                or idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri.</li>
            <li>The swelling of the optic disc in papilledema is 
                typically bilateral and symmetric. It is often associated with visual disturbances, including blurry vision, 
                decreased visual acuity, and sometimes even vision loss, especially if left untreated.</li>
            <li>Diagnosis of papilledema is typically made through a comprehensive eye examination, including fundoscopic
                evaluation of the optic nerve head. Imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans may be performed to identify the underlying cause 
                of increased intracranial pressure.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Pseudopapilledema</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pseudopapilledema refers to optic disc swelling that is not caused by increased intracranial pressure. Instead, it is often due to structural anomalies or
                other non-pathological conditions.</li>
            <li>Unlike papilledema, pseudopapilledema typically does not cause visual disturbances or vision loss. It may be an incidental finding during routine eye examination.</li>
            <li>Common causes of pseudopapilledema include crowded optic nerve heads, drusen (calcifications) on the optic nerve head, optic nerve head draping, or optic nerve head hypoplasia.</li>
